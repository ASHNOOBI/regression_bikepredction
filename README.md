# regression_bikepredction
Welcome to the Bike Prediction Regression project! This repository hosts the code and resources for a data-driven regression analysis that aims to predict bike demand based on various factors. Predicting bike usage is crucial for bike-sharing systems and urban planning to optimize the availability of bikes and improve user experience.

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

The project involves the following steps:-

Understanding of Business Objective
Data Cleaning
